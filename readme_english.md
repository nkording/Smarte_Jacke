# Smart Jacket

### The development, design and manufacture of the prototype was carried out as part of a bachelor's thesis at the University of Applied Sciences in Osnabr√ºck, Germany.

The smart jacket allows anyone to upgrade their own jacket to a smart jacket. The smart functions include fall detection, a panic button, a visual and audible alarm and an automatic text message to an emergency contact. These functions are provided by two components: an app and the electronics attached to the jacket.

The components for the electronics are available from retailers. Basic knowledge in various areas is required for assembly: sewing, programming and soldering. Apart from that, assembly is possible using simple means. The components include: an Arduino Nano RP2040 Connect, an Active Buzzer, a high-power LED and a PMMA fiber.

The smart jacket can detect a fall while walking or cycling and generate an alarm with light and noise as well as send a text message to an emergency contact. The alarm can also be activated via a button and used as a panic button.
